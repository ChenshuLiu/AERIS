# WHYS

**WHYS**, stands for "**W**hys **H**ows and **Y**our **S**olutions", which is an sub-process of AERIS to help you sort your ideas, questions, and random thoughts. 

Have you ever experienced the following feelings?
- Always having random ideas FLYING to you and you have a difficult time keeping track?
- When reading a research paper, you run into a reference paper that you have question for or have similar ideas with, but you are not done with reading the current paper, so you saved that paper in your browser folder. Then the same thing happens over and over, so the number of papers/ideas you want to further investigate piles up.

WHYS is the key to help. On the front end, it looks just like a note-taking checklist, you append your questions, ideas, possible solutions to the list. WHYS then employs LLM to identify the key topics within your input, categorize it with the existing entries from previous inputs, and even draw interconnections. Finally, you are able to see how your ideas congregates/envolves through visualizations.
